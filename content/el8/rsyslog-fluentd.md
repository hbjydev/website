# Centralised logging

There comes a point in any set of infrastructure that begins to grow larger
than ~10 nodes when you need to begin centralising metrics, control and
information about your instances and services. Logs are a form of information
that are very useful to troubleshooting and reporting on the health of your
systems, but are generally quite difficult to collect in one useful place.

This guide will go over the installation & configuration of rsyslog, fluentd
and OpenSearch, a free (_truly_ open-source) alternative to Elasticsearch.

## Requirements

- A dedicated log ingest server, with a recommended ~2GB RAM and 2 CPU cores
- An OpenSearch cluster, or a node with room to run the OpenSearch service as
  well as its Kibana fork, OpenSearch Dashboards. I recommend 3-4GB RAM and 4
  CPU cores on this instance.
- Much coffee. _Don't skip this step._

## Components

So the individual working components of this system are:

- [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/), a Syslog daemon that can forward or
  receive syslog data over TCP or UDP, as well as a bunch of other cool things.
- [fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/), a data collection tool that aggregates,
  formats and unifies all of your different types of logs based inputs, filters
  and outputs.
- [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), a data storage and indexing tool that
  makes ingesting, searching through, visualising and analysing your data easy.

These systems all come together to allow you to send all of your hosts' logs to
a single, centralised storage system, which will allow you to quickly and
easily go through them, making troubleshooting a large number of services much
easier.

## Architecture

In this deployment, the architecture I generally follow is one where you have a
dedicated log forwarding host, which ingests syslog data from other services
and passes it all into fluentd, and a separate storage cluster which holds the
actual logging data.

So in this instance, let's say I have my syslog server running on the internal
IP of 172.16.1.10. Let's say I have an OpenSearch ingest node on 172.16.2.3.
All of the hosts on my network will have rsyslogd configured with an action on
every kind of log to send everything to 172.16.1.10.

rsyslogd on the syslog server will be configured to send all its logs to the
local fluentd service. Because of how rsyslogd works, this will include the
logs forwarded from our other servers too. Once those logs hit fluentd, it will
parse those logs, extrapolate any metadata stored in them (timestamp, host,
message, level, etc.), put them into a unified format, and forward them to
OpenSearch.

Once everything is in OpenSearch, I can use its visualisation tool, OpenSearch
Dashboards, to view and search through all of my logs from my various servers.

## Step 1. OpenSearch Installation

So, on a RHEL 8-based server, rsyslog is installed by default. This includes
its derivatives, such as Rocky Linux and CentOS. So we don't need to install
anything extra on our individual hosts.

However, on our syslog server, we also need to install fluentd. Fluentd is
packaged for bare metal servers as `td-agent`, or the Treasure Data Agent, and
are fully endorsed by fluentd themselves. So let's head over to the
[fluentd downloads page](https://www.fluentd.org/download) and grab the latest
RHEL-compatible RPM build of `td-agent`, v4.1.1 at the time of writing.

We click on the RHEL8 link, and we get taken to Treasure Data's td-agent
download page.

From there, we can copy the link to the latest `.rpm` file, which we can run
a `dnf install` on to download it onto our syslog server.
